My name is Bern Carney, short for _Bernard Carney_.

How things work, and how I can make them work better, is what interests me. Ever since I designed my first website and put together my first computer when I was young, I have been passionate about technology. For the past 8 years I have been expanding that skill-set professionally.

I have extensive project control and management experience both in the private and public sectors; and most recently I branched out into sales to grow my understanding of the industry as well as what consumers want... but my passion still lies within project management. My specialties include, but are not limited to: process streamlining, project management, developing standard operating procedures, budget/timeline/scope management, complete software development lifecycle, resource management, IT operations and business management liaison, team development, relationship building.
