    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div id="aboutContainer">
    <p>My name is Bern Carney, short for <em>Bernard Carney</em>.</p>
    <p>How things work, and how I can make them work better, is what interests me.</p>
    <p>Ever since I designed my first website and put together my first computer when I was young, I have been passionate about technology. For the past 7 years I have been expanding that skill-set professionally. I have extensive project control and management experience both in the private and public sectors; and most recently I branched out into IT sales to grow my understanding of the industry... but my passion still lies with project management.</p>
    <p>My specialties include, but are not limited to: process streamlining, project management, developing standard operating procedures, budget/timeline/scope management, complete software development lifecycle, resource management, IT operations and business management liaison, team development, relationship building.</p>
