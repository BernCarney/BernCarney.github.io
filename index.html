    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div id="aboutContainer">
    <p>My name is Bern Carney, short for <em>Bernard Carney</em>.</p>
    <p>How things work, and how I can make them work better, is what interests me.</p>

    <h3>COMSO, Inc.</h3>
    <p>With COMSO, Inc. I streamlined software development processes and created more efficient and transparent means to track ongoing work. In what started as a very segmented development unit, I helped create a close-knit and efficient group. We shifted to an agile development methodology and I introduced tools such as JIRA to form a more structured and effective team.</p>
